abstract: "There is mixed evidence regarding how organized crime organizations become
altruistic or violent after a natural disaster. This paper analyses the effect of the
2017 earthquakes that hit Mexico on the incidence of violence and altruism committed
by large and local criminal organizations. Using a difference-in-differences
methodology; there is a significant increase in the probability that a municipality
suffers an incidence of violence committed by local criminal organizations by 5%,
but no effect on violence incidences committed by large criminal organizations. A
Spatial Point Pattern Test (SPPT) reveals that this increase in violent crimes is localized
in six municipalities, mostly forming a spatial cluster in Mexico City. In addition,
the results show that large criminal organizations behave non-altruistically,
whereas local criminal organizations increase their social altruism activities by 7%.
In all, the earthquakes seem to affect the behavior of local criminal organizations
but not that of large criminal organizations."
