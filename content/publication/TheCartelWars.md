abstract: "The number of major drug trafficking organizations in Mexico increased from four to nine over the last two decades. This was accompanied by an increase in drug trade related violence. This paper examines the relationship between competition and violence in illegal drug markets. In particular I exploit an external demand shock to the heroin market, the 2010 OxyContin reformulation. I construct a novel data set of cartel presence across municipalities by scraping Google News and using natural language processing. I exploit within municipality variation from combining agro-climatic conditions to grow opium poppy with heroin prices in the United States across time. Event study estimates suggest that cartel presence increases substantially after 2010 in municipalities well suited to grow opium poppy. Homicide rates increase in the number of active cartels per municipality, with the higher increases when a second and third cartel become active in the territory.These results suggest that some of the increase in violence that Mexico experienced in the last fifteen years can be attributed to criminal groups fighting for market shares of heroin."
